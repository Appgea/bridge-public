/**
 * The evidence box — what happened, shown inside the post that reported it.
 *
 * A deeplink used to mean "leave". You tapped a screenshot, a file, a Play flow button, and the
 * app threw you into another project, another tab, another screen you then had to walk back from.
 * For reading an agent's report that is the wrong trade: you are not going there to work, you are
 * going there to LOOK. So every reference a post carries resolves here instead — the edit replay,
 * a file at the line the agent named, a screenshot at full size — in a box under the post, and
 * the trip into the real surface stays available as one explicit ↗.
 *
 * The replay is the same theater the Files tab uses (`rr-overlay` is absolute, so it fills our
 * stage instead of the window). Nothing here writes anything.
